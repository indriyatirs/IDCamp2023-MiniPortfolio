# IDCamp2023-MiniPortfolio
IDCamp is a scholarship program organized by Indosat Ooredoo Hutchison with the aim to produce young Indonesian developers/programmers who are ready to compete in the world of digital economy.

The IDCamp 2023 online training module was developed by Dicoding, which is a Google Authorized Training Partner in Indonesia. In developing the material, Dicoding in collaboration with Indosat Ooredoo Hutchison uses use cases that are often found in the industrial world, especially in the telecommunications and digital fields. In addition, this program is also strengthened by the online mentoring method.

This repository serves to show the results of the mini portfolio or final project that I worked on during the IDCamp 2023 program in the Data Scientist basic and beginner classes.
